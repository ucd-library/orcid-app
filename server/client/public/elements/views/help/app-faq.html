  <h3>UC Davis Library, College of Engineering, and Energy Eciency Institute ORCID Pilot</h3>

  <h4>What is the purpose of this pilot?</h4>
  <p>
    We would like the name of our institution to appear in a consistent manner on a public record. 
    We found out over 25 ways in which University of California, Davis appears in the affiliation 
    section of ORCID records. Some of those are due to spelling mistakes. In addition, the 
    participating College and Institute are interested in a consistent display of their affiliations. 
    We have designed a web app that writes your latest employment with UC Davis to your ORCID record.
  </p>

  <h4>I already have an ORCID iD. Do I need to do anything for this pilot?</h4>
  <p>
    Yes, please. The ORCID iD Optimizer will write your latest employment to your record in a 
    consistent manner and with UC Davis as the authoritative source for that information. In 
    addition, the app will make suggestions on enriching your record. For example, even though 
    there are a number of ways to set the record to auto-update with new publications, only a 
    quarter of existing ORCID profiles have any data in their Works section. 
  </p>

  <h4>I have been employed at UC Davis since the beginning of my tenure-track position in 
    2015, but the ORCID iD Optimizer allows me to write in only my latest promotion to 
    Associate Professor in 2018. Is there a way to fix that?</h4>
  <p>
    We can only write the latest position to your record based on official data available 
    to us from UC Davis employment records.
  </p>

  <h4>I see multiple entries of my current position. Why is that?</h4>
  <p>
    We extract your current title, affiliation and start date from university databases.  
    There are two university data sources that contain this information -- your official 
    payroll title and that from the universities online directory. Either source can be 
    added to your ORCID record. Often, the online directory title is more informative 
    about your role because you have input on how it is formulated. If you don’t have 
    an online directory title, you can request one here: <a href="http://directory.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">http://directory.ucdavis.edu</a>, 
    under Update My Directory Listing.  Note that both of these sources can contain multiple entries, 
    and so you may have more than two positions to choose from.  Because of the payroll system, 
    some positions may appear very similar.  You are not required to choose any of these 
    predefined positions.
  </p>

  <h4>Why are College of Engineering/ Energy Efficiency Institute appearing separate from my 
    department/title record?</h4>
  <p>
    One of the goals of the pilot is to highlight the affiliated faculty and/or staff with 
    the participating entities beyond department level.
  </p>

  <h4>I have already entered my affiliation with UC Davis, and now I have a duplicate employment 
    entry on my record. Can’t the app remove duplicate entries?</h4>
  <p>
    The app can only edit/remove information written through the app. The ORCID record is 
    entirely under your control, and only you can remove information you entered.
